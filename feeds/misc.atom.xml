&lt;p&gt;Welcome on my blog, I think it's a good practice to a software engineer to have
a blog. So, I decided to start my own one. I will principally publish technical
articles without claims, sometimes I will also write about others subjects. I
have a very easy goal, try to write a minimum of five articles per year.
Sometimes that will be very short and very simple, sometimes more longer. A
good reason to write articles is improve our technical skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Pelican&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose Pelican because it's a Python project it's really easy to use. I really
like the simplicity of the project. I can contribute to the project if I want
or and need. A lot of plugins and themes is available. It's a static engine so
it's really easy to deploy and secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I start my blog and I will start to publish several articles. I really like
write, that will be not easy in English but a good exercise I hope that will be
useful and I'm sure that will be fun.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Misc"></category><category term="python"></category><category term="pelican"></category></entry></feed>
